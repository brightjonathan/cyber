<h4> some security checkups using CaneryTokens by station X (hidden hacker traps!)</h4>
<a href="https://www.stationx.net/canarytokens/">CanaryTokens</a>



<ul>
<h4> Using the DNS/HTTP in CanaryTokens </h4>
  <li> Generate the token either DOCX or PDF </li>
  <li> Re-Name it and distribute it all your file  </li>
  <li> Put sensitive infor in the word doc as a trap </li>
</ul>

<ul>
<h4> Using the Browser Scanner</h4>
  <li> click on we bugs  </li>
  <li>  go to another email and send the url   </li>
  <li> once the link is been clicked it triggers the token in your mail box </li>
</ul>

<h2>Things to protect</h2>
<h4>What is most confidential?</h4>
<h4>What you cannot afford to lose?</h4>
<h4>What is irresplaceable?</h4>
<h4>What could cause the most damage?</h4>
<h4>What could damage your reputation?</h4>


<p> What to protect </p>
<ol>
<li> self / Family </li>
<li> Organization service </li>
<li> Application </li>
</ol>

<h3> My Security Assests</h3>
<p> Protect what your value like E.g <p>
<ul>
  <li>photo</li>
  <li>Credit card details</li>
  <li> Bank acct </li>
  <li>personel identifier infor</li>
  <li>Brower hstory</li>
  <li>password infor</li>  
</ul>


<h4> Privacy and Anonymity</h4>
<p> <b> Privacy </b> is nobody see what you are doing but knows who did it. it's about confidientality E.g (sending encryted email to your friend only you and the password has access) </p>
<p> <b> Anonymity </b> Anonymity means being completely nameless, unknown, and unidentifiable. It involves hiding one's identity, making it impossible to trace actions or information back to the individual. Anonymity is often achieved through measures like: 
- Using anonymous networks (e.g., Tor)
- Encryption
- Virtual private networks (VPNs)
- Anonymous browsing tools
</p> 
<p> <b>Pseudonymity</b> involves using a fictional name or identifier, allowing individuals to remain identifiable only by a pseudonym. This means their real identity is not revealed, but their pseudonymous identity can be traced back to their online activities. Examples include:

- Usernames or handles
- Pen names
- Avatars
- Screen names
 </p> 


<p> <b>Risk = </b>(Vulnerabilities * Threats * Consequences) </p>

<h4> What is security bug/Vulnerabilities? - are flaws/bugs in a computer system that weaken the overall security of the system. </h4>

<p> Two types of Bug (1) Know Bugs - have patches (2)UnKnown Bugs - No patches </p>



<ol>
<h3> what is malware? - is a deceptive/mallicious software designed to cause disruption to a computer, server, client, or computer network, leak private information, gain unauthorized access to information or systems, deprive access to information, or which unknowingly interferes with the user's computer security and privacy. <b> Examples</b></h3>

   <li> Macro Virus </li>
   <li> Stealth Virus </li>
   <li>Polymorphic Virus </li>
   <li> Self-grabling virus </li>
   <li> Bots & Zombies virus </li>
